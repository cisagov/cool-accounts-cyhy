[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-accounts-cyhy/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-accounts-cyhy/actions)

This project contains Terraform code to perform the initial configuration of a
COOL Cyber Hygiene (CyHy) account. This Terraform code creates and configures
the most basic resources needed to build out services and environments.

It creates an IAM role that allows sufficient permissions to provision all AWS
resources in this account. This role has a trust relationship with the COOL
users account.

## Bootstrapping this account ##

Note that the COOL Cyber Hygiene account must be bootstrapped. This is because
initially there is no IAM role that can be assumed to build out these resources.
Therefore you must first apply the Terraform code using programmatic credentials
for AWSAdministratorAccess as obtained for the COOL Cyber Hygiene account from
the COOL AWS SSO page.

After this initial apply your desired IAM role will exist, and it will be
assumable from your IAM user that exists in the COOL users account. Therefore
you can apply future changes using your IAM user credentials.

To do this bootstrapping, follow these steps:

1. Comment out the `profile = "cool-cyhy-provisionaccount"` line for the
   "default" provider in `providers.tf` and directly below that uncomment the
   line `profile = "cool-cyhy-account-admin"`.
1. Create a new AWS profile called `cool-cyhy-account-admin` in your local
   configuration using the "AWSAdministratorAccess" credentials (access key ID,
   secret access key, and session token) as obtained from the COOL Cyber Hygiene
   account:

   ```ini
   [cool-cyhy-account-admin]
   aws_access_key_id = <MY_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
   aws_secret_access_key = <MY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
   aws_session_token = <MY_SESSION_TOKEN>
   ```

1. Create a Terraform workspace (if you haven't already done so) by running
   `terraform workspace new <workspace_name>`
1. Create a `<workspace_name>.tfvars` file with any optional variables
   that you wish to override (see [Inputs](#inputs) below for
   details):

   ```hcl
   tags = {
     Team        = "VM Fusion - Development"
     Application = "COOL - Cyber Hygiene"
     Workspace   = "production"
   }
   ```

1. Run the command `terraform init`.
1. Run the command `terraform apply -var-file=<workspace_name>.tfvars`.
1. Revert the changes you made to `providers.tf` in step 1.
1. Create a new AWS profile called `cool-cyhy-provisionaccount` in your local
   configuration that includes the `provisionaccount_role` ARN output from the
   previous step, for example:

   ```ini
   [cool-cyhy-provisionaccount]
   role_arn = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/ProvisionAccount
   role_session_name = your.session.name
   source_profile = cool-user-base-profile
   ```

1. Run the command `terraform apply -var-file=<workspace_name>.tfvars`.

At this point the account has been bootstrapped, and you can apply future
changes by simply running `terraform apply -var-file=<workspace_name>.tfvars`.

Running `pre-commit` requires running `terraform init` in every directory that
contains Terraform code. In this repository, this is just the main directory.
